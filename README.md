# Library Management System And Stored Procedures
This project is a Library Management System developed using SQL. It encompasses tables for managing books, borrowers, library branches, book loans, book copies, authors, and publishers. Users can perform tasks such as adding books, managing borrower information, tracking book loans, and checking available copies. Stored procedures are implemented to streamline common operations like counting book copies and retrieving borrower details. The project aims to provide an efficient system for managing library resources and operations.
